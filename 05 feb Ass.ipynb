    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the technique of hiding the complexity of a class and its objects from other parts of the program. It involves combining data and functions into a single unit, and restricting access to the internal details of the object. This helps to ensure the integrity of the data and prevents accidental modification or misuse of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying essential features of an object and ignoring non-essential details. It involves creating abstract classes and interfaces that define the common behavior of a set of objects, without specifying the details of their implementation. This helps to simplify the design of complex systems and makes it easier to manage changes in the system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class. It involves creating a new class (called a subclass or derived class) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class) and adding or modifying its properties and behavior. This helps to promote code reuse and reduces duplication of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or behaviors depending on the context in which it is used. It involves creating methods that can be applied to objects of different classes, and allowing objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. This helps to increase the flexibility and extensibility of the system."
